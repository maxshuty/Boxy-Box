# Boxy-Box
An old app I built similar to Flappy Bird to try and learn Phaser.js and how games built in JavaScript work. Obviously when I built this Flappy Bird was still cool.

Original README: 
You thought Flappy Bird was cool? Check this out! (Made using Phaser.io)

The code for the game lives in [**`main.js`**](https://github.com/maxshuty/Boxy-Box/blob/master/BoxyBox/scripts/main.js)
